## MoodSwinger

We observed that in veteran families, individuals often express profound emotions — speaking of the innocence and honor of young soldiers, sometimes breaking into tears that deeply affect their loved ones. To support these moments with sensitivity, we developed an application that allows family members to discreetly capture a picture of the individual. Using Bose SoundTouch technology, the application detects the emotional state from the image and plays music tailored to their feelings, providing comfort without intruding on their experience.

## Getting Started

We have a web application where we click the image of the veteran and recognise the current emotion on the face of the person. After recognising it, we select a playlist based on their emotion without bothering them and help them calm down. This application has been developed keeping in mind to control the anxiety issues of the veterans and help them make a smart home.
